                <p>Chase Mitchusson is a PhD candidate in Experimental Music & Digital Media at LSU, VR developer,
                    composer, and computer music instructor. He researches emerging technologies for the purpose of
                    connecting music to digital media in order to create new interfaces which help people express
                    themselves. As part of teams in production classes and Global Game Jams, Chase has helped develop
                    several games and experiences in Unity and Unreal Engine. His work with VR has
                    been an effort to supplement creators’ toolkits and augment live musical performances. Chase's other
                    interests include coding web audio, field recording, and live multi-channel sound.
